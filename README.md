# SI507_Final_Project: Travel recommendation system in big cities in the U.S.

This is a travel location recommendation system.
And I used Google Map's Places API as the data source to grab the tourist location information of the top six cities in the US (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Phoenix) as a json file.

There is no restriction on the API acquisition. It is public.

This project uses tkinter as the interactive interface. 
The user is filtered by four options, namely city, location type, rating, and number of reviews, and the user receives the recommended places to visit after entering the four options.
